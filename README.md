# Introduction

For this project, I had to reproduce some basic HTML and CSS as outlined in a design spec *(assets/design spec/design-spec.webp)*. This gave me elements to copy and dimensions, but no indication as to what flexbox properties I would have to use. This was left down to me to calculate.

## Process

1. Boilerplate HTML added

2. Basic structure outlined as shown in design spec, split into nav, reasonably split sections, and footer

3. HTML content added in order shown in design spec (previewed webpage in browser as I went along to ensure there were no errors)

4. Body styles added according to spec

5. Styles applied to rest of elements as outlined in design

6. Once confirmed that the previous steps have been completed correctly, flexbox properties applied to content

7. Previewed in browser and compared with design spec - once happy that I had perfectly reproduced the content and styles, I made my final commit and pushed everything to Github
